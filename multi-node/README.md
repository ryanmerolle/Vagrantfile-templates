# Multi-Node Vagrantfile leveraing hosts.yaml

I threw in some specific configurations for network devices vs endpoints.

I would love to speed up provisioning and slim down resources in a future update.  It might be as effecient as possible already.

## Eventual Features:
* tweaks for handling other network vendor virtual devices like
  * CSR 1000V
  * ASAv is that even possible?
  * vSRX
  * vMX
* Ansible use cases & testing
